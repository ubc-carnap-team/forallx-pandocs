Natural Deduction Proofs in QL {#ch.QLND}
==============================

Trees employ a kind of 'brute force' strategy for proving entailment
claims. When the logical structure of the relevant sentences are rather
simple, as they are in SL and in some QL cases, it can be an effective
strategy, but in some cases they can become very tedious and complex. It
is useful to have a proof system that allows one to reason in a more
targeted way --- especially if you already have an intuitive
understanding of why a given argument should be expected to turn out
valid. As we did in Chapter
[\[ch.ND.proofs\]](#ch.ND.proofs){reference-type="ref"
reference="ch.ND.proofs"} for SL, in this chapter we will consider a
natural deduction system for quantified logic. As in the case of trees,
our QL natural deduction system is an extension of the one we learned
previously for SL.

Like our SL natural deduction system, our system can only be used to
demonstrate that an argument *is* valid. We do not have a formal method,
as part of our natural deduction system, for demonstrating an argument
*invalid*. In this respect natural deduction differs from trees. We
won't go through the proof in this book, but the natural deduction is
both sound and complete. That means that there are natural deductions
proofs corresponding to all and only the valid arguments in QL.

Natural Deduction: the basics
-----------------------------

In a natural deduction system, one begins by writing down the
assumptions one begins with --- these correspond to the premises of an
argument --- then adds a series of additional sentences, justified via a
series of particular rules by the sentences above. Additional
assumptions may be made and discharged along the way. If one succeeds in
writing down the conclusion of the argument on a new line, with no
additional undischarged assumptions, consistent with the natural
deduction rules, one has proven that the conclusion follows from those
premises. If you need a refresher on how that works, review Chapter
[\[ch.ND.proofs\]](#ch.ND.proofs){reference-type="ref"
reference="ch.ND.proofs"}.

Our QL system will use all the same sentential rules that our SL system
did. All the introduction and elimination rules for the sentential
connectives, as well as the derived and replacement rules, will be part
of this system too. (These are summarized, along with our new rules, in
the Quick Reference guide at the end of this book.) We'll add
introduction and elimination rules for the existential and universal
quantifiers, and some other derived rules as well.

Basic quantifier rules
----------------------

Recall the relationship between quantified sentences and their
instances. The sentence $Pa$ is a particular instance of the general
claim $\forall x Px$. For any wff , constant , and variable , we define
to mean the wff that we get by replacing every occurrence of in with .
is called a of $\forall x\metaA{}$ and $\exists x\metaA{}$, and is
called the . This should be familiar from our discussion of our tree
rules for quantifiers in Chapter
[\[ch.QLTrees\]](#ch.QLTrees){reference-type="ref"
reference="ch.QLTrees"}. We will also use this notation to describe our
quantifier rules.

### Universal elimination

If you have $\forall x Ax$, it is legitimate to infer, of anything, that
it is $A$. You can infer $Aa$, or $Ab$, or $Az$, or $Ad_3$, etc.. This
is, you can infer any substitution instance -- in short, you can infer
$A\script{c}$ for any constant . This is the general form of the
universal elimination rule ($\forall$E):

Remember that the box mark for a substitution instance is not a symbol
of QL, so you cannot write it directly in a proof. Instead, you write
the substituted sentence with the constant replacing all occurrences of
the variable in , as in this example:

This rule is very similar to the tree rule for universals, which, in our
tree system, allowed one to develop a branch containing a universal with
any instance of it one likes. Here you are permitted to write down any
instance you like on a new line.

### Existential introduction

When is it legitimate to infer $\exists x Ax$? If you know that
something is an $A$ --- for instance, if you have $Aa$ available in the
proof.

This is the existential introduction rule ($\exists$I):

It is important to notice that is not necessarily a substitution
instance. We write it with double boxes to show that the variable does
not need to replace all occurrences of the constant . You can decide
which occurrences to replace and which to leave in place. For example,
each of lines 2--6 can be justified by $\exists$I:

### Universal introduction

A universal claim like $\forall x Px$ would be proven if every
substitution instance of it had been proven, if every sentence $Pa$,
$Pb$, $\ldots$ were available in a proof. Alas, there is no hope of
proving *every* substitution instance. That would require proving $Pa$,
$Pb$, $\ldots$, $Pj_2$, $\ldots$, $Ps_7$, $\ldots$, and so on to
infinity. There are infinitely many constants in QL, and so this process
would never come to an end.

Consider a simple argument: $\forall x Mx$,  $\forall y My$

It makes no difference to the meaning of the sentence whether we use the
variable $x$ or the variable $y$, so this argument is obviously valid.
Suppose we begin in this way:

We have derived $Ma$. Nothing stops us from using the same justification
to derive $Mb$, $\ldots$, $Mj_2$, $\ldots$, $Ms_7$, $\ldots$, and so on
until we run out of space or patience. We have effectively shown the way
to prove $M\script{c}$ for any constant . From this, $\forall y My$
follows.

It is important here that $a$ was just some arbitrary constant. We had
not made any special assumptions about it. If $a$ had already been
mentioned, say as a premise in the argument, then this would not show
anything about *all* $y$. For example:

This is the schematic form of the universal introduction rule
($\forall$I):

$^\ast$ The constant must not occur in any undischarged assumption.

Note that we can do this for any constant that does not occur in an
undischarged assumption and for any variable.

Note also that the constant may not occur in any *undischarged*
assumption, but it may occur as the assumption of a subproof that we
have already closed. For example, here is a valid proof of
$\forall z(Dz \eif Dz)$ that does not use any premises.

### Existential elimination

A sentence with an existential quantifier tells us that there is *some*
member of the UD that satisfies a formula. For example, $\exists x Sx$
tells us (roughly) that there is at least one $S$. It does not tell us
*which* member of the UD satisfies $S$, however. We cannot immediately
conclude $Sa$, $Sf_{23}$, or any other substitution instance of the
sentence. What can we do?

Suppose that we knew both $\exists x Sx$ and $\forall x(Sx \eif Tx)$. We
could reason in this way:

> Since $\exists x Sx$, there is something that is an $S$. We do not
> know which constants refer to this thing, if any do, so call this
> thing 'Ishmael'. From $\forall x(Sx \eif Tx)$, it follows that if
> Ishmael is an $S$, then it is a $T$. Therefore, Ishmael is a $T$.
> Because Ishmael is a $T$, we know that $\exists x Tx$.

In this paragraph, we introduced a name for the thing that is an $S$. We
gave it an arbitrary name ('Ishmael') so that we could reason about it
and derive some consequences from there being an $S$. Since 'Ishmael' is
just a bogus name introduced for the purpose of the proof and not a
genuine constant, we could not mention it in the conclusion. Yet we
could derive a sentence that does not mention Ishmael; namely,
$\exists x Tx$. This sentence does follow from the two premises.

We want the existential elimination rule to work in a similar way. Yet
since English language worlds like 'Ishmael' are not symbols of QL, we
cannot use them in formal proofs. Instead, just as we did in the
analogous rule within our tree system, we will use names that are *new*
--- names which do not appear anywhere else in the proof. (This includes
the conclusion you are aiming for.)

A constant that is used to stand in for whatever it is that satisfies an
existential claim is called a . Reasoning with the proxy must all occur
inside a subproof, and the proxy cannot be a constant that is doing work
elsewhere in the proof.

This is the schematic form of the existential elimination rule
($\exists$E):

$^\ast$ The constant must not appear outside the subproof.

Remember that the proxy constant cannot appear in , the sentence you
prove using $\exists$E. (It would actually be enough just to require
that the proxy constant not appear in $\exists\script{x}\metaA{}$, in ,
or in any undischarged assumption. In recognition of the fact that it is
just a place holder that we use inside the subproof, though, we require
an entirely new constant which does not appear anywhere else in the
proof.)

The existential elimination rule, like the rules for conditional
introduction and negation introduction and elimination, is a rule that
involves discharging an assumption. Assume a proxy instance, and see
what would follow from that instance; if you have the existential, then,
you can stop making the assumption about the proxy, and help yourself to
what would have followed from it. As with those other
assumption-involving rules, instead of a justification, one includes a
note --- in this case, 'for $\exists$E' --- about the role of the
assumption in the proof. Remember that assumptions must be discharged
before your proof is complete, so you should only make an assumption
that goes beyond your premises when you have a plan for discharging it.

With this rule, we can give a formal proof that $\exists x Sx$ and
$\forall x(Sx \eif Tx)$ together entail $\exists x Tx$.

### Quantifier negation

$\enot\exists \script{x}\enot\metaA{}$ is logically equivalent to
$\forall \script{x}\metaA{}$. The first says that *nothing falsifies* ;
the second says *everything satisfies* . In QL, they are provably
equivalent. Here is a proof schema for half of that equivalence via a
natural deduction reductio. For any wff , variable , and new name :

$^\ast$ Where name does not appear outside the subproof.

This is a proof *schema* --- it is not itself a proof in QL, as its
lines are not QL sentences. But it describes how a proof of this form
can be given. For example, here is one instance of the above schema:

(Note that this proof encodes the same form of reasoning one would
employ to demonstrate via a tree that
$\forall y Ay \models \enot \exists y \enot Ay$. As an exercise: draw
out the tree to compare it.)

In order to fully demonstrate that
$\enot\exists \script{x}\enot\metaA{}$ is logically equivalent to
$\forall \script{x}\metaA{}$, we would also need a second proof that
assumes $\enot\exists \script{x}\enot\metaA{}$ and derives
$\forall \script{x}\metaA{}$. We leave that proof as an exercise for the
reader.

It will often be useful to translate between quantifiers by adding or
subtracting negations in this way, so we add two derived rules for this
purpose. These rules are called quantifier negation (QN):

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----
    $\enot\forall\script{x}\metaA{} \Longleftrightarrow \exists\script{x}\enot\metaA{}$ 
    $\enot\exists\script{x}\metaA{} \Longleftrightarrow \forall\script{x}\enot\metaA{}$ QN
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----

QN is a replacement rule. Like our SL replacement rules (DeMorgan,
Double Negation, etc.), it can be used on whole sentences or on
subformulae.

Identity Introduction
---------------------

The introduction rule for identity is very simple. Everything is
identical to itself; so, for any name , one may write --- regardless of
what one has on the previous lines of the proof --- that
$\script{a}{=}\script{a}$:

The =I rule is unlike our other rules in that it does not require
referring to any prior lines of the proof. We need only cite the rule
itself; it does not reference any previous line numbers.

Identity Elimination
--------------------

If you have shown that $a{=}b$, then anything that is true of $a$ must
also be true of $b$. For any sentence with $a$ in it, you can replace
some or all of the occurrences of $a$ with $b$ and produce an equivalent
sentence. For example, if you already know $Raa$, then you are justified
in concluding $Rab$, $Rba$, $Rbb$. Recall that
$\metaA{}\substitutesome{a}{b}$ is the sentence produced by replacing
$a$ in with $b$. This is not the same as a substitution instance,
because $b$ may replace some or all occurrences of $a$. The identity
elimination rule (=E) justifies replacing terms with other terms that
are identical to it:

Here is a simple proof of an instance of the *transitivity of identity*.
Let's prove that if $a{=}b$ and $b{=}c$, then $a{=}c$:

æp æp

At line 4, we took advantage of the identity claim $b{=}c$ on line 3,
and replaced the $b$ in line 2 with a $c$. Then we used the familiar I
rule to discharge the assumption of line 1, proving the conditional we
were aiming for.

Translation and evaluation
--------------------------

Consider this argument: There is only one button in my pocket. There is
a blue button in my pocket. So there is no non-blue button in my pocket.

We begin by defining a symbolization key:

UD: buttons in my pocket

Bx: $x$ is blue.

Because we have no need to discuss anything other than buttons in my
pocket, we've restricted the UD accordingly. If we included other things
(buttons elsewhere and/or things other than buttons), we'd need
predicates corresponding to being a button and things' locations. The
simple version here is adequate for our present needs. The argument is
translated as:

$\forall x \forall y\ x{=}y$

$\exists x Bx$

$\enot \exists x \enot Bx$

So the set-up for a natural deduction proof will be:

There are various strategies one might employ. Here are two clues that
point toward one promising strategy. Note again that we have an
existential on line 2 --- this suggests existential elimination as a
possible strategy. Note also that we are aiming for
$\enot \exists x \enot Bx$, which equivalent to
$\enot \enot \forall x Bx$ by QN. This in turn is equivalent, by DN, to
$\forall x Bx$, which suggests that universal introduction is going to
be an important step. If we introduce an assumption with a proxy
instance of $\exists x Bx$, we'll be able to work toward a generic
instance of $Bx$. In this example, we'll take $e$ as our proxy, and show
that $Bf$ follows from $\exists x Bx$:

By line 7, we have discharged the assumption about the proxy --- we
won't use the name $e$ any more --- we have established that $Bf$
follows from the two premises. Since $f$ is an arbitrary name --- one
that does not appear in any undischarged assumption --- we can perform
universal introduction on that instance. This in turn lets us complete
the proof via the two substitution rules mentioned above:

Natural deduction strategy
--------------------------

All the strategy advice given in
§[\[sec.SL.ND.strategy\]](#sec.SL.ND.strategy){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec.SL.ND.strategy"} is equally applicable to natural
deduction proofs in QL. Review the suggestions there for general advice
for natural deduction proofs. Applied to our new QL rules, if you have a
universal, you can think about taking any instances that look useful.
(Taking random instances is unlikely to be useful.) If you have an
existential, consider using the existential elimination rule, which
begins by assuming an instance with a proxy, then deriving a conclusion
that does not contain that proxy name.

Showing $\enot \exists x\metaA{}$ can also be hard, and it is often
easier to show $\forall x\enot \metaA{}$ and use the QN rule.

Soundness and completeness
--------------------------

The proofs for soundness and completeness of our natural deduction
system are beyond the scope of this textbook. But if you are interested
in thinking through how those proofs would go, here are a few hints to
get you started. Soundness in a natural deduction system amounts to the
claim that if any sentence is derivable from a set of sentences , then
$\metaSetX{}\models\metaA{}$. To prove this, you would need to
demonstrate that any possible natural deduction proof meets this
constraint. This is trivial for 'proofs' that only contain premises;
you'd next have to show, for every possible way of extending the proof
(i.e., everything permitted by any one of our rules), that any newly
added lines with no undischarged assumptions are entailed by the
premises.

Undischarged assumptions would require special treatment. You can think
of an assumption as being similar to a 'temporary premise' --- what you
really want to prove is that, for every possible line in a proof, that
line is entailed by the premises *in addition to* any undischarged
assumptions.

The completeness proof is more complex. We need some way to guarantee
that there is a proof corresponding to every QL entailment. The way to
do this is to find an algorithmic procedure that is guaranteed to find a
proof if one exists, and to prove that this is so. One good way to do
this is to take advantage of the proven completeness of our *tree*
system for QL, presented in Chapter
[\[ch.QLsoundcomplete\]](#ch.QLsoundcomplete){reference-type="ref"
reference="ch.QLsoundcomplete"}, and find a way to demonstrate that any
tree proof can be converted to a natural deduction proof. Here is a hint
if you'd like to undertake that project: the tree method encodes the
same kind of reasoning that reductio proofs do.
